'OtowanMaja' might refer to a location or a building name, and 'Number Seven (7)' could be a street number or an apartment number.  If you have the correct company name, registration number, or other relevant identifier, please provide it, and I'll do my best to answer your questions.\n",

      "Finding information about companies can often be done via online searches using search engines such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo or specific company databases.  You can start with a general search including the company name and location to help filter results. Official company registers maintained by local or national governments can give detailed and reliable information, although access might be restricted sometimes. Specialized online business directories may also provide some information, and for publicly traded companies, dedicated financial websites can be useful resources.  If it is a local business, visiting the local chamber of commerce or similar organizations may help.  Social media platforms can be another point of contact, but be sure to look at official, verified pages of the business.  Finally, directly contacting the company itself can provide the necessary information and clarify any uncertainties.  Please keep in mind that information availability varies depending on the company, local regulations and disclosure requirements.\n",
