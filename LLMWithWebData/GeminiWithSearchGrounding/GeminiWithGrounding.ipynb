Therefore, information like registered address, CEO, establishment year, number of employees, revenue size, website, NAICS code, SIC code, status, and dissolvement year are not applicable in the same way as for a regular business.  Instead, it acts as a temporary title holder for either the relinquished or replacement property in a 1031 exchange.
