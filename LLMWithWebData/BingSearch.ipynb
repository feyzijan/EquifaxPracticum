For this reason, before the reconstruction of the Iino Building, the registered head office was located in the same place as the head office of Iino Kaiun. Since then, the company has grown to its main business in handling air cargo, and in July 2006, it absorbed Kei Logistics Co., Ltd., a marine freight forwarder of the same Kawasaki Kisen Group, and
