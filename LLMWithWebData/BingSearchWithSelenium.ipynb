We took a bit of a sabbatical and now the Lord has lead us to take our ministry out into the highways and the hedges. We are playing music in rehabilitation centers, hospital and anywhere we are invited and welcome to come. What a joy it is to return to our roots. We have been blessed to meet some wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ in the facilities we go to and God is just good!! We are no longer pastoring a \\\\\"brick & mortar\\\\\" church. The change has been good and we are so blessed. I will try to get back into the habit of posting here and maybe even put up some audio/video music clips.

What does it mean for the industry, competitors, our community? SEJ STAFF Jenise Uehara 5 hours ago \\\\u22c5 5 min read SEJ STAFF Jenise Uehara CEO at Search Engine Journal Bio Follow 30 SHARES Dear Readers, SEO Pros, and Digital Marketers, Hello, I\\\\u2019m Jenise . I\\\\u2019ve been at the SEJ helm for 15 years, with Loren Baker and Brent Csutoras at my side as majority owners and operating partners. Yesterday, I woke up to a monumental piece of news: SEO news publisher Search Engine Land was purchased by marketing tool company Semrush . There\\\\u2019s an elephant in the room, so let\\\\u2019s start there. What happens when a large search marketing industry player buys a prominent media outlet focused on the search marketing industry? Will the publisher\\\\u2019s coverage remain objective and agnostic? Will its authoritative guides include the breadth and depth of tools and platforms and services available \\\\u2013 some of which are in direct competition with Semrush? What happens to Search Engine Land\\\\u2019s reams and reams of existing content \\\\u2013 articles, white papers, ebooks, videos \\\\u2013 that refer to Semrush competitors (umm, not to mention their backlinks) ? What about credible viewpoints from respected authors that run counter to the new corporate party lines in some way? Will those voices still be published, amplified, quoted on SEL? Or watered down, or even silenced? So many questions. Community reactions, so far, have been either of a benign, congratulatory nature or else focused on concerns of bias. Screenshot from LinkedIn , October 2024 Screenshot from LinkedIn , October 2024 Screenshot from X (Twitter) , October 2024 Screenshot from LinkedIn , October 2024 Screenshot from X (Twitter) , October 2024 Screenshot from X (Twitter) , October 2024 SEL and Semrush both have been active in responding on social media, reiterating that : \\\\u201cOur plan is to continue to remain independent and unbiased. Our goal is to provide quality knowledge as we always have.\\\\u201d I do believe that these are their intentions for the existing editorial team, for now. I\\\\u2019m curious to see whether this independence will stand the test of time, after the dust has settled and the news of this acquisition is lining our digital bird cages. I\\\\u2019m interested in finding out if SEL\\\\u2019s editorial freedom will stand the test of shareholder interests in an NYSE-traded company that made $305 million in revenue last year. I think we will need to wait and see. Here\\\\u2019s Where Search Engine Journal Stands As one of the last independent publishers in the SEO industry, SEJ remains bootstrapped and unbossed. No one pulls SEJ\\\\u2019s strings, controls our backlinks, our coverage, or our messaging. That\\\\u2019s right. SEJ is the honey badger of SEO journalism: We report what we want, when we want, how we want. SEJ is still committed to reporting the truth ( well, the truth until things change with the algorithms ) about what is happening in SEO and marketing. SEJ is still committed to providing unbiased education and best practices for our readers. A.k.a. business as usual here at SEJ. Who Is Search Engine Journal Anyways? Our team of 26 folks around the world is made up of writers, editors, designers, technologists, the back office who keep things running smoothly, sales operations. They make me so proud, if I may brag a little. We encourage transparency, experimentation, accountability. We don\\\\u2019t tolerate office politics or toxic behavior. I like to think we\\\\u2019re close-knit. We share, we cuss, we amuse each other with silly memes. We have laughed together and cried together. Most importantly, when the sh* hits the fan, we pull together. We rally. We get gritty. Over and over. I ask the team to try again, to improve, to keep learning \\\\u2013 and they do it. And that is when you know you have an A-Team on your hands. That\\\\u2019s the entire roster \\\\ud83d\\\\ude0e. SEJ has no investors. No corporate overlords. And we want it that way. Our independence has been challenging at times. It would be nice to have a corporate Daddy Warbucks who can \\\\u201cdarken the skies with people,\\\\u201d as one of my favorite consultants liked to say. And so it does give me pause when a rival publisher is now backed by a multi-national company with over 1,000 employees. That\\\\u2019s a monumental amount of resources, firepower, and reach. But over the years, SEJ\\\\u2019s independence has ensured our team\\\\u2019s ability to provide 100% unbiased journalism and education for the search marketing community. We do what we want. And this is what I have faith in: That our readers, our advertisers, our community will provide what we need to be a formidable David to this new Goliath. I welcome your comments, feedback, and ideas to make Search Engine Journal what the search marketing community needs it to be now. Leave me a message here, and I promise to reply .

Reply Reply to Anonymous on October 17, 2024 12:39 pm From this to their practice of buying projects solely to kill them, Blumhouse deserves to be shunned not celebrated. Reply Reply to Anonymous on October 17, 2024 12:13 pm As if anyone needed another reason not to work with Blumhouse Reply Reply to Anonymous on October 17, 2024 10:43 am Is his argument basically that AI is a tool for kids? Because that\\\\u2019s certainly not who the AI companies are marketing to solely. Another point, every single working filmmaker today didn\\\\u2019t seem to have a problem dreaming big without AI. Not to mention, what happens when the kid becomes an adult and doesn\\\\u2019t know how to solve certain filmmaking problems without the use of AI. And don\\\\u2019t give me the \\\\u201cinevitable\\\\u201d argument. It\\\\u2019s only inevitable because we\\\\u2019re ALLOWING tech companies to pursue it with zero regulation or restrictions. This isn\\\\u2019t some act of God we can\\\\u2019t stop lol Reply Reply to Aardvark on October 17, 2024 8:49 am I hope audiences fundamentally reject this.

The year-long Macosko Fellowship crowdfunding campaign garnered overwhelming support from donors of all magnitudes, culminating in a total of $103,000 in new gifts and commitments, which was further amplified by a significant contribution of $50,000 from an anonymous matching gift donor. Our community\\\\u2019s collective generosity has made a significant impact on this graduate fellowship fund, established by Emeritus Professor Chris Macosko and his wife, Kathleen, in 2010. The current Macosko Fellows bring international perspectives to Amundson Hall. Mohammad Asaf Zaki, hails from Varanasi, India with a background in Materials Science from the esteemed IIT Varanasi. Zaki is dedicated to addressing pressing environmental challenges through his research focus on electrocatalysis. Similarly, Saranya Velliyarat brings a wealth of talent and ambition to the realm of Materials Science. Hailing from Kerala, India, Velliyarat\\'s research endeavors center on unraveling the dynamics of quantum matter. These donations have had a tremendous impact across CEMS. As Department Head Dan Frisbie notes, \\\\u201cit is humbling and energizing to see so many of our alumni and friends invest in the future of graduate education in CEMS, while also honoring Professor Macosko\\'s legacy of excellence in teaching and research. \\\\u201c In heartfelt appreciation of the donors\\' generosity, Chris Macosko reflects on the significance of their contributions stating, \\\\u201cKathleen and I are honored to see so many folks respond to the match opportunity. They know how valuable this financial support is for attracting outstanding graduate students. We enjoy meeting the students and following their career growth at the U. \\\\u201c We at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science would like to echo Dan and Chris\\\\u2019 remarks with our own sincere gratitude. We are excited for each student\\\\u2019s future in the Department and hope to provide support for more students in the coming years. Quotes from the 2024 Macosko Fellows: Why CEMS? Saranya Velliyarat: \\\\u201c CEMS has the best professors with expertise across various disciplines. Its interdisciplinary and collaborative atmosphere sets it apart, making it truly exceptional. Mohammad Asaf Zaki: \\\\u201cI have been keen on solving pressing environmental problems because it makes me anxious about imagining the future world. I desired the best guidance and topmost research facilities at my disposal to use my skills and talent to work for a better tomorrow.I am excited to push myself intellectually and develop more skills while working with exceptional people\\\\u201d How would you describe the CEMS community? SV: Whether it\\\\u2019s through informal discussions, collaborative projects, or attending departmental events together, my peers in CEMS provide invaluable support and encouragement, making the department feel like a welcoming and inclusive community. How has the Macosko Fellowship impacted your life, education, and future? SV: The generosity of CEMS alumni has profoundly shaped my academic journey and allowed me to pursue my passion for research. Without this fellowship, my dream of doing a PhD in materials science and engineering wouldn\\\\u2019t have been possible. The support has not only given me financial help, but also motivated me to work harder and more creatively in my research. I\\\\u2019m thankful for the CEMS community\\\\u2019s help and I\\\\u2019m determined to do my best to make them proud. MZ: Being able to use science and engineering as a career and making a positive impact on the world by using my skills and intellect is a gift for me. I promise to work even harder and commit myself towards innovation and impactful results, which leads to a better future in the clean energy domain. I thank the CEMS donors from the bottom of my heart for their trust in me.

We took a bit of a sabbatical and now the Lord has lead us to take our ministry out into the highways and the hedges. We are playing music in rehabilitation centers, hospital and anywhere we are invited and welcome to come. What a joy it is to return to our roots. We have been blessed to meet some wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ in the facilities we go to and God is just good!! We are no longer pastoring a \\\\\"brick & mortar\\\\\" church. The change has been good and we are so blessed. I will try to get back into the habit of posting here and maybe even put up some audio/video music clips.

We are playing music in rehabilitation centers, hospital and anywhere we are invited and welcome to come. What a joy it is to return to our roots. We have been blessed to meet some wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ in the facilities we go to and God is just good!! We are no longer pastoring a \\\\\"brick & mortar\\\\\" church. The change has been good and we are so blessed. I will try to get back into the habit of posting here and maybe even put up some audio/video music clips.

A Nonprofit is a non-business entity, organization or institution that is not conducted or maintained for the purpose of making a profit. In the U.S., a non-profit organization is formed at the state-level and then may seek tax-exempt status - typically by applying to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). At the state and local level, sales tax and property taxes may be exempt as well.

Churches and Religious Organizations Churches and religious organizations, like many other charitable organizations, may qualify for exemption from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3). Private Foundations Every organization that qualifies for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) is classified as a private foundation unless it meets one of the exceptions listed in Section 509(a). Private foundations typically have a single major source of funding (usually gifts from one family or corporation rather than funding from many sources) and most have as their primary activity the making of grants to other charitable organizations and to individuals, rather than the direct operation of charitable programs. Political Organizations A political organization subject to Section 527 is a party, committee, association, fund or other organization (whether or not incorporated) organized and operated primarily for the purpose of directly or indirectly accepting contributions or making expenditures, or both, for an exempt function.

We took a bit of a sabbatical and now the Lord has lead us to take our ministry out into the highways and the hedges. We are playing music in rehabilitation centers, hospital and anywhere we are invited and welcome to come. What a joy it is to return to our roots. We have been blessed to meet some wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ in the facilities we go to and God is just good!! We are no longer pastoring a \\\\\"brick & mortar\\\\\" church. The change has been good and we are so blessed. I will try to get back into the habit of posting here and maybe even put up some audio/video music clips.

Category: Common NAICS Questions The U.S. Census Bureau assigns and maintains only one NAICS code for each establishment based on its primary activity (generally the activity that generates the most revenue for the establishment). Since other federal government agencies, trade associations, and regulation boards maintain their own lists of business establishments and assign classification codes based on their own programmatic needs, this will vary by agency. Yes, some agencies assign more than one NAICS codes to one establishment. For instance, the SAM (System for Award Management formerly CCR ), where businesses register to become federal contractors, will accept up to 5 or 10 classification codes per establishment. You will need to contact the other agencies to find out what their policies are. For access to a list of federal government agencies, click here .

Category: Common NAICS Questions NAICS will be reviewed every five years (in the years ending in \\\\u20182\\\\u2019 or \\\\u20187\\\\u2019) for potential revisions so that the classification system can keep pace with the changing economy. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), through its Economic Classification Policy Committee (ECPC), will solicit public comments through a notice published in the Federal Register. The notice will provide details of the format in which comments should be submitted, to whom they should be submitted, and the deadline for submission. Generally, the comment period will close 90 days after publication of the notice. During that time, suggestions for new and emerging industries can be submitted to the ECPC. This committee will review each comment submitted to determine its feasibility and adherence to the underlying principles of NAICS, consult with the NAICS counterparts in Canada and Mexico to determine if they can accept the proposed changes that would impact 3-country comparability, and then make final recommendations to OMB for additions and changes to the NAICS manual. This process is now completed for the 2022 revision of NAICS. The next scheduled review of NAICS will be for a potential 2027 revision. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 34 8 l How Can I Determine the Correct NAICS Code for My Business? Category: Common NAICS Questions NAICS was designed and documented in such a way to allow business establishments to self-code. There are a number of tools and references available to help you to determine the most appropriate NAICS code for your business: You can use our Powerful Search Tool to find any NAICS code quickly and easily. Enter a keyword that describes your kind of business. A list of primary business activities containing that keyword and the corresponding NAICS codes will appear. Choose the one that most closely corresponds to your primary business activity, or refine your search to obtain other choices. Rather than searching through a list of primary business activities you may also browse the NAICS Codes and Titles to find your code. You can select the category that applies to your business, and drill down through the more detailed levels until you find the appropriate 6-digit code. If you know your old SIC code, you can use our Powerful Search Tool to locate the corresponding NAICS code. Simply enter the SIC code and the corresponding NAICS code(s) will appear. To see the NAICS code associated with a specific business listing, use our US Business Directory Company Lookup Tool. For more help with using the NAICS Search tool, click here .

Category: Common NAICS Questions There is no \\\\u201cofficial\\\\u201d way to have a company\\\\u2019s SIC or NAICS code changed. Various Federal government agencies maintain their own lists of business establishments, and assign classification codes based on their own programmatic needs. Generally, the classification codes are derived from information that the business establishment has provided on administrative, survey, or census reports. For this reason, we recommend that you contact the agency that has assigned the code that you believe should be changed. For example, if you question the SIC or NAICS code contained on a form received from OSHA, you should contact the Department of Labor.

The long-term objective of NAPCS is to develop a market-oriented, or demand-based, classification system for products that (a) is not industry-of-origin based but can be linked to the NAICS industry structure, (b) is consistent across the three NAICS countries, and (c) promotes improvements in the identification and classification of service products across international classification systems, such as the Central Product Classification System of the United Nations. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 10 1 l I Have Seen NAICS Codes with More than 6 Digits. What are These? Category: Common NAICS Questions Industries in the United States are identified by a six-digit code. Each manufacturing and mining product or service is identified by a ten-digit product code. The product coding structure represents an extension, by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, of the six-digit industry classification of the manufacturing and mining sectors. The product classification system operates so that the industrial coverage is progressively narrower with the successive addition of digits. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 12 0 l What is an Establishment and what is an Enterprise? Category: Common NAICS Questions An establishment is generally a business or industrial unit at a single, physical location that produces or distributes goods or performs services (e.g., store, factory, farm, etc.). An enterprise, on the other hand, may consist of more than one location performing the same or different types of economic activities. Each establishment of that enterprise is assigned a NAICS code based on its own primary activity. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 21 2 l What is an establishment? [RE: THE NAICS CODE SYSTEM] Category: Common NAICS Questions An industry classification system facilitates the collection, tabulation, presentation, and analysis of data relating to establishments and ensures that data about the U.S. economy published by U.S. statistical agencies are uniform and comparable. NAICS ensures that such data are uniform and comparable among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. [SOURCE: US NAICS MANUAL] Did you find this FAQ helpful? 9 2 l What is NAICS and How is it Used? Category: Common NAICS Questions The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS, pronounced Nakes) was developed as the standard for use by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments for the collection, analysis, and publication of statistical data related to the business economy of the U.S. NAICS was developed under the auspices of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and adopted in 1997 to replace the old Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. It was also developed in cooperation with the statistical agencies of Canada and Mexico to establish a 3-country standard that allows for a high level of comparability in business statistics among the three countries. NAICS is the first economic classification system to be constructed based on a single economic concept. Click here to learn more about the background, the development and the difference between NAICS and the SIC.

Category: Common NAICS Questions NAICS categories do not distinguish between small and large business, or between for-profit and non-profit. The Small Business Administration (SBA) develops size standards for each NAICS category.

[SOURCE: US NAICS MANUAL] Did you find this FAQ helpful? 12 0 l What is Title 13? Category: Common NAICS Questions Title 13, U.S. Code, Section 9 (a) prohibits the U.S. Census Bureau from disclosing individual company activities including NAICS and SIC codes. The Census Bureau is bound by Title 13 of the United States Code. These laws not only provide authority for the work the census does, but also provides strong protection for the information collected from individuals and businesses. Title 13 provides the following protections to individuals and businesses: Private information is never published. It is against the law to disclose or publish any private information that identifies an individual or business such, including names, addresses (including GPS coordinates), Social Security Numbers, and telephone numbers. The Census Bureau collects information to produce statistics. Personal information cannot be used against respondents by any government agency or court. Census Bureau employees are sworn to protect confidentiality. People sworn to uphold Title 13 are legally required to maintain the confidentiality of your data. Every person with access to your data is sworn for life to protect your information and understands that the penalties for violating this law are applicable for a lifetime. Violating the law is a serious federal crime. Anyone who violates this law will face severe penalties, including a federal prison sentence of up to five years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. Title 13, U.S. Code is available to download from the Government Printing Office here [PDF 311KB]. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 9 4 l Where Can I Get a Current List of NAICS Codes? Category: Common NAICS Questions We have several easy to use references available: The Industry Drill-Down provides a complete list of 6-digit codes along with links to the full descriptions and cross-reference to similar codes. The NAICS Manual & Downloadable Reference Files can be purchased here. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 9 14 l Who Assigns NAICS Codes to Businesses and How? Category: Common NAICS Questions There is no central government agency with the role of assigning, monitoring, or approving NAICS codes for establishments. NAICS Codes are self-assigned based on the establishment\\\\u2019s primary activity (the activity that generates the most revenue for the establishment) Individual establishments are assigned NAICS codes by various agencies for various purposes using a variety of methods. The U.S. Census Bureau has no formal role as an arbitrator of NAICS classification. The U.S. Census Bureau assigns one NAICS code to each establishment based on its primary activity (the activity that generates the most revenue for the establishment) to collect, tabulate, analyze, and disseminate statistical data describing the economy of the United States. Generally, the U.S. Census Bureau\\\\u2019s NAICS classification codes are derived from information that the business establishment provided on administrative, survey, or census reports. (e.g. when a company applies for an Employer Identification Number (EIN), information about the type of activity in which that business is engaged is requested in order to assign a NAICS code). Various other government agencies, trade associations, and regulation boards adopted the NAICS classification system to assign codes to their own lists of establishments for their own programmatic needs. If you question the SIC or NAICS code contained on a form received from an agency other than the U.S. Census Bureau, you should contact that agency directly. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 17 13 l Who assigns NAICS codes to businesses and how? Category: Common NAICS Questions There is no central government agency with the role of assigning, monitoring, or approving NAICS codes for establishments. Different agencies maintain their own lists of business establishments to meet their own programmatic needs. These different agencies use their own methods for assigning NAICS codes to the establishments on their lists. Statistical agencies assign one NAICS code to each establishment based on its primary activity. For example, the Social Security Administration assigns a NAICS code to new businesses based on information provided on their application for an Employer Identification Number. The Census Bureau generally assigns NAICS codes to businesses on its list of establishments based on information provided by the business on a survey or census report form. The Bureau of Labor Statistics initially assigns NAICS codes based on business activity information provided on an application for unemployment insurance. [SOURCE: US NAICS MANUAL] Did you find this FAQ helpful? 11 8 l Why are Some NAICS Codes Only 5-digits long? Category: Common NAICS Questions NAICS is a two-through-six-digit hierarchical classification code system, offering five levels of detail. Each digit in the code is part of a series of progressively narrower categories, and the more digits in the code signify greater classification detail. The first two digits designate the economic sector, the third digit designates the subsector, the fourth digit designates the industry group, the fifth digit designates the NAICS industry, and the sixth digit designates the national industry. A complete and valid NAICS code contains six digits. In developing NAICS, the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed that the 5-digit codes would represent the level at which the system is comparable among the three countries. The sixth digit allows for each of the countries to have additional detail (i.e., subdivisions of a 5-digit category). In cases where the U.S. did not choose to create additional detail, the 5- and 6-digit categories within U.S. NAICS are the same, and the 6-digit US NAICS code ends in zero. In some hierarchical presentations, the 6-digit code is omitted where it is the same as the 5-digit category. Did you find this FAQ helpful? 15 0 l Will U.S. International Trade Data be Available on a NAICS Basis? Category: Common NAICS Questions Data on international trade in goods are necessarily collected on a commodity basis, whereas NAICS and SIC, data are on an establishment basis. Commodity groups approximating the NAICS categories were developed, however, and published for the years 1997 through 1999. (These overlap with series for groups using SIC commodity group classifications in the year 1997.) It should be noted that some of the kinds of distinctions made in NAICS and other industry classifications cannot be made in commodity trade data. A notable example is printing and publishing. NAICS places publishing in the new Information industry and retains only printing in manufacturing. In commodity trade data, however, the entire value of imported and exported publications is included in the goods classification \\\\u201cPrinting, publishing and similar products.\\\\u201d For additional information, please visit the USITC website.

The SIC covers the entire field of economic activities by defining industries in accordance with the composition and structure of the economy. Over the years, it was revised periodically to reflect the economy\\\\u2019s changing industry composition and organization. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last updated the SIC in 1987. Before long, the rapid changes in both the U.S. and world economies brought the SIC under increasing criticism. The 1991 International Conference on the Classification of Economic Activities provided a forum for exploring the issues and for considering new approaches to classifying economic activity. In July 1992, the OMB established the Economic Classification Policy Committee chaired by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce, with representatives from the Bureau of the Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. The OMB charged the ECPC with conducting a \\\\u201cfresh slate\\\\u201d examination of economic classifications for statistical purposes and determining the desirability of developing a new industry classification system for the United States based on a single economic concept. A March 31, 1993, Federal Register notice (pp. 16990-17004) announced OMB\\\\u2019s intention to revise the SIC for 1997, the establishment of the Economic Classification Policy Committee, and the process for revising the SIC.
