## LLMWithWebData
### BingSearch.ipynb
- Use the bing search API to search the web for "Firm_Name + Fields", store the results in firms_web_search_results.db (stored in google drive)

### WebscraperForBingResults.ipynb
- Loop through the firms_web_search_results.db, scrape the contents of the top 5 websites in each cell, save results to firms_web_search_website_scrapings.db (stored in google drive)

### GeminiWithLocalDataset
- Loop through the firms_web_search_results.db and firms_web_search_website_scrapings.db, ask Gemini to predict the value of the field based
on this data. Save results to firm_database_llm.db


## GeminiWithSearchGrounding
- Directly ask Gemini to generate predictions for every field without using a local dataset, but instead using the Grounding with google search feature to look at the web automatically.
- Save results to firm_database_gemini_with_grounding


# Files to analyze for results
gemini_with_grounding_results_raw.csv : Predictions generated by Gemini with Grounding enabled
gemini_with_local_dataset_results_raw.csv: Predictions generated using our own web search and webscraping datasets
opencorporates_reference_data.csv : Opencorporates data of the firms we looked at

- Only some of our predicted fields are in opencorporates
- Need to assess the accuracy, hit ratio, etc of all the fields we predict, how these are distributed across firms based on their incorporation date etc..

Note: Our prediction csv fiels arent very clean (have some new line characters, some invalid values etc.) needs to be cleaned
