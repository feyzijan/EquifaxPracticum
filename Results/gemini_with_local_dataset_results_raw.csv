","Vernon Sankey, Co-Founder and Katey Lockwood, Co-Founder (Improvemyworld, associated with The Way Course for CEOs).  It is unclear if ""#LIMITLESS Way"" refers to a specific company or is a more general term.  There are multiple companies and programs with ""Limitless"" in their name.  The provided information does mention a ""Limitless Women"" founded by Laura Gisborne, but this does not appear to be the same entity as ""#LIMITLESS Way"". Dan Soleau is listed as Principal/Operations Manager of Limitless Wireless, LLC, but this company appears to be defunct.
