While Pioneer Title has hundreds of employees, the LLCs associated with 1031 exchanges are typically small, holding title to properties temporarily as part of a tax strategy.  The search results show various similarly named  Pioneer Exchange Accommodation Titleholder LLCs, numbered sequentially, suggesting they are individual entities formed for specific transactions rather than a large workforce.
